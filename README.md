# aiPacman
AI driven Pacman

This Project was coined by UC Berkeley, further details can be found in the link below - 
http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

Aim here is to create a AI driven pacman, which can detect corner food and ghost, and can take appropriate action in real time, with goal to eat all food pellets as early as possible. 

Started in September 2018, it is still in development phase. I will be providing a detailed description once all aspects of project are completed. As of now, AI logic is defined in following files -

search.py	
searchAgents.py	

To play the game yourself use the command below  -

python pacman.py
